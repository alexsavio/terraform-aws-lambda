# terraform-aws-lambda


Terraform module designed to facilitate the creation of AWS Lambda functions.


---


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).





## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda/releases).


### Simple Example
```hcl
module "lambda" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda.git?ref=master"
}
```
